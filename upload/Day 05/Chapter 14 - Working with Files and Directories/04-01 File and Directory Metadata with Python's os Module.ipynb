    "2. **Bit 3 (Setuid bit):** If set, this bit allows a file to be executed with the privileges of its owner, rather than the user running the file. For example, if a user runs a program with the setuid bit set, the program runs with the privileges of the file owner (e.g., root).\n",
    "3. **Bit 4 (Setgid bit):** If set, this bit allows a file to be executed with the group privileges of its group. For directories, it ensures that new files created within inherit the directoryâ€™s group ownership.\n",

    "**Real-World Example of Special Bits:**\n",
    "- **Setuid (Set User ID):** For a binary file like **/usr/bin/passwd**, the setuid bit is often set. This means when any user runs the **passwd** command to change their password, it runs with root privileges to modify the systemâ€™s password file.\n",
    "- **Setgid (Set Group ID):** For shared directories, the setgid bit ensures that new files created in the directory inherit the directoryâ€™s group ownership, promoting collaborative work.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why These Bits Matter:**   \n",
    "These special bits provide enhanced control over how files and directories are accessed and manipulated:\n",
